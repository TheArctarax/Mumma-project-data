# GWmemory natively features a frequency domain converter for memory but not for waveforms.
# This method fixes that problem by following the same structure as frequency_domain_memory().

# Q1 : Start by looking at the frequency_domain_memory definition you quoted. Here, we want
#      to define a new function called `frequency_domain_transform`, which takes in two
#      arguments - time_domain_waveform (which is basically either the memory, or the oscillatory)
#      and times (the sampling times array), and do a fourier transform to the frequency
#      domain, and finally, returns the frequency_domain_waveform and sampling frequencies
#      to the user (so two products). Modify the code in frequency_domain_memory to attain
#      the above goals.

Window Types provided by scipy.signal.windows.get_window
[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.get_window.html#scipy.signal.windows.get_window]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'boxcar': no window
'triang': triangular window, nonzero endpoints
'blackman': 3rd order cosine sum, minimizes leakage, almost as good as Kaiser window at doing so
'hamming': single cosine with nonzero endpoints, minimizes first side lobe
'hann': hamming window but with zero endpoints
'bartlett': triangular window but with zero enpoints, used to taper with little fd modulation
'flattop': 5th order cosine sum, used to measure signal amplitude, makes main lobe flat
'parzen': not sure about this one
'bohman': or this one, either
'blackmanharris': generalized hamming = more cosines, hamming but better
'nuttall': similar to blackman-harris
'barthann': combo of bartlett and hann
('kaiser', beta): formed from Bessel functions, beta=0(rect), 5(hamming), 6(hann), 8.6(blackman)
('gaussian', std_dev): use only in special cases
('general_gaussian', power, width): same here
('slepian', width): maximizes power in main lobe
('dpss', norm half-bandwidth): first term is slepian window
('chebwin', attenuation): uses Chebyshev polynomials, kinda complicated
('exponential', decay constant): seems like it will cut power too quickly
('tukey', taper fraction): tf=0(rect), 1(hann)
